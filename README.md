# foreman-apps

foreman-apps contains all of the open-source Java applications that collect and provide cryptocurrency miner metrics to the Foreman dashboard, enabling users to monitor their operations abroad.

## Status ##

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/delawr0190/foreman-apps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/delawr0190/foreman-apps)

## Applications ##

This repository currently contains the following applications:

- Pickaxe

### Pickaxe ###

Pickaxe is an open-source Java application that will extract metrics from cryptocurrency miners and upload them directly to Foreman.

You can find the documentation and getting started guides for pickaxe on the [Foreman dashboard](https://dashboard.foreman.mn/dashboard/support/pickaxe/).  Note: you must be logged in to view the dashboard and all guides.

At a high-level,

1. Download pickaxe [(latest)](https://github.com/delawr0190/foreman-apps/releases).
2. Unzip pickaxe.
3. Add miners to `conf/pickaxe.yml` following the examples provided.
4. Start pickaxe.

Pickaxe queries the APIs built into each miner (most have this, and most are enabled by default).  If you're having trouble configuring pickaxe to connect to your miner, consult the miner's documentation on how to enable it.  Example:  according to [ccminer's README](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/blob/windows/README.txt), providing `--api-remote` will enable the API.

## Requirements ##

- JDK version 8
- Apache Maven (only if building Pickaxe from sources)

## Building ##

To build the entire foreman-apps repository, which will build all of the Foreman applications:

From the top level of the repository:

```sh
$ mvn clean install
```

Upon a successful build, you should see something similar to the following:

```sh

```

The application distributions can be found in the `target/` folders.  You'll only need one - pick the extension you prefer.

```sh
$ ls -la **/target | grep -E "\.(zip|tar)"
